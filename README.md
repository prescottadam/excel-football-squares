# excel-football-squares
An Excel spreadsheet that can be used to generate numbers for a fooball squares pool.

## Usage
1. Download file [here](https://github.com/prescottadam/excel-football-squares/raw/master/squares-generator.xlsx)
2. Generate new numbers by changing _anything_ in the spreadsheet
3. Copy numbers to where they're needed

**Tip!** If you have an electronic copy of the square assignments (who owns which square), you can copy/paste into the generator spreadsheet. The copy/paste will trigger new random values to be generated; you'll have a printable copy and be done.
